I thought the challenge was fun and challenging at times. I found it energizing for the most part. It was a lot of practice of knowledge I gained from Prime and on my own. But of course with every project I gain more knowledge. Always learning something new. 

I think this project really forces that learning curve because you are given set instructions and design so you are forced to make it like how it shows so there's no workarounds of just sticking with something you know. You have to push through to figure it out to make it happen that specific way. 

I started the application from scratch using React, Javascript, Material UI, CSS, HTML, Redux, Sagas, Express, Node, Jest, SQL. 
It is set up for database name: 'jamf_submission' in pool.js file. Database code is in database.sql

I really wanted to make this a responsive design so I changed up the design a bit to make it more responsive friendly. I felt the original side bar wouldnt work well with a responsive mobile design. So I moved the side bar from being on side to up top. I also thought the green bullets indicating what view the user was on wasn't the most user friendly as it was hard to tell against the gray - they were small and also if you were colorblind that would be difficult. So I made the indication more apparent covering that whole section up top on the nav.

I struggled the most with the app-icon placement. I was trying to figure out the best place to put it when considering responsive design. It felt awkward and best spot I came up with was the bottom left corner. I wanted to still show I could accomplish the cutoff of it like in the original. I had a tough time getting it to be responsive. Still at this point it is not perfect as it overlaps the other elements if you move the page up enough. 

Lastly I didn't put the buttons on the bottom - once again due to responsiveness and the icon placement. If made mobile it would cluster together or cause the icon to be inbetween form and buttons which wouldn't want. 


Overall I think this is a better fit for responsive but I do like how clean the original is for desktop.
